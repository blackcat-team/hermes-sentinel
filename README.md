# Hermes-sentinel

Hermes Sentinel is a standalone server-first monitoring service. It
answers one primary question: is one of my VDS boxes dead, or
approaching a bad state?

Sentinel is **observability only**: it receives telemetry and performs
read-only external checks. It never executes commands on, deploys to,
or modifies monitored hosts.

## Status

Initial development — Stage B5 (Heartbeat HTTP Server Bridge) on
top of the Stage B4 heartbeat HTTP request adapter, the Stage B3
authenticated heartbeat wire boundary, the Stage B2 heartbeat
ingestion core and the Stage B1 SQLite persistence foundation.

Stage B5 is a plaintext backend listener
(`http.server.HTTPServer` + `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`, stdlib raw
HTTP parsing only). It is not a production Internet-facing
endpoint: production reporters use outbound HTTPS; TLS termination
belongs to later hardening.
